    "* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.\n",
    "* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.\n",
    "* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.\n",
    "* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.\n",
    "* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.\n",
    "* Compare multiple logistic regression models."

Also, dry during the rainy ones.The full-body window provides me with the ability to see that she is buckled up safely at any time during the walk.  It enables her to see things just about as well as when the shield is off.The yellow color is definitely a color contrast to our navy colored stroller but it sure makes us visible to oncoming vehicles.Construction appears to be very good. The material reminds me of a very duty plastic tarp (not like the cheap ones you find at the big discount retailers).  I would imagine this would be repairable with a inner tube patch kit or clear adhesive caulk for the window if it ever needed it.I would definitely purchase this again.'"
